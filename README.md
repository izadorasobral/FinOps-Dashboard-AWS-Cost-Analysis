# FinOps Dashboard – AWS Cost Analysis with Power BI

## 📄 Description
This dashboard was developed using Power BI to monitor and analyze AWS service costs, applying FinOps best practices. It provides clear visualizations by service, region, tags (dev, test, prod), and time periods, helping to optimize expenses and improve resource management in the cloud.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Monitor and visualize **AWS costs over time**.
- Identify **services with the highest financial impact**.
- Analyze usage by **region** and **environment tags**.
- Support **cost optimization decisions** based on FinOps practices.
